# Building the source

The project uses gradle as the build tool. Multi project build was set up for the ease of development.

Use the following command to build all the services

```
./gradlew build
```

# Run the services

To run any service, run the following command 
```shell
java -jar services/product/build/libs/product-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
java -jar services/review/build/libs/review-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
java -jar services/recommendation/build/libs/recommendation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

```

Start all the services
```shell
java -jar services/product-composite/build/libs/product-composite-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
java -jar services/product/build/libs/product-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
java -jar services/recommendation/build/libs/recommendation-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
java -jar services/review/build/libs/review-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar &
```

Stop the services with

```shell
kill $(jobs -p)
```
